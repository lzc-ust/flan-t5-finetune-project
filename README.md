# FLAN-T5 Fine-Tuning Project

This project aims to fine-tune the FLAN-T5 model using the `ali-alkhars/interviews` dataset for technical interview question answering. The goal is to enhance the model's performance in generating relevant and accurate responses during technical interviews.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd flan-t5-finetune-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare the Dataset**
   Download the `ali-alkhars/interviews` dataset and place the files in the `data/interviews_dataset` directory.

4. **Configure Training Settings**
   Modify the `configs/training_config.json` and `configs/model_config.json` files to set your desired training parameters and model configurations.

## Usage

To start the fine-tuning process, run the following command:
```bash
python src/train.py
```

## Dataset Information

The dataset used for fine-tuning is the `ali-alkhars/interviews` dataset, which contains various technical interview questions and answers. This dataset is designed to help the model learn to generate appropriate responses in a technical interview context.

## Model Information

This project utilizes the FLAN-T5 model, a variant of the T5 model optimized for few-shot learning tasks. The model's architecture and tokenizer settings can be configured in the `configs/model_config.json` file.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the contributors of the `ali-alkhars/interviews` dataset and the developers of the FLAN-T5 model for their valuable work in the field of natural language processing.
